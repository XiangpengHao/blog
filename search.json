    "text": "Signs of bad advisors\n\nAll happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. – Leo Tolstoy\n\nLike unhappy families, bad advisors are pretty novel in their ways of being bad; we don’t summarize them here. Instead, we list some key symptoms of working with a bad advisor.\n\nLong time-to-recovery, i.e., too long to recover from a meeting with your advisor.\n\nRegular meetings with your advisor can be stressful; often the time you need to prepare many slides, teach your advisor about your work, and try to get some feedback. Often, especially in the early stages of your Ph.D., you don’t have good presentation/communication skills to explain your work to your advisor. Your advisor can get impatient and think you are not progressing or working hard enough.\nThis can be frustrating and demotivating, and this pattern repeats every week. The question is, how long does it take to recover from this meeting? I have experienced that it can take a few hours, or even an entire day, to recover from the frustration and continue to work on my research. However, it does not have to be this way; a good advisor can motivate students and give concrete feedback to help them improve.\n\nNot being treated like a human, but a tool/machine to generate papers.\n\nGraduate students are first humans, then students, and then researchers, but never tools/machines to generate papers.\nMost bad advisors treat their students as leverage to fulfill their own goals. They often have very concrete expectations from their students: publish X papers in Y top-tier conferences/journals and work on Z topics with W skill sets. They evaluate their student by whether they can meet those expectations; even worse, those expectations are often inexplicit and change over time.\nIf students lag behind expectations – which happens all the time – they are often blamed for not working hard enough or not being smart enough. Worse, they will be threatened to delay graduation, withdraw funding, or even be kicked out of the program. Even if students are on track, they are often not appreciated for their hard work and dedication. They are given more work to do, and the cycle repeats.\nGraduate study is a long journey; without being treated like a real human, you feel suffering, lonely, and lost. But you deserve a supportive, fruitful, and enjoyable PhD study.\n\nNot aware of power dynamics, but you are my boss.\n\nMany people dreamed an advisor-advisee relationship would be like a marriage partnership: they respect, trust, and work together to achieve common goals.\nBut that is never the case in reality; advisors pay their students’ salaries, and they can decide when they can graduate. The conversation between an advisor and a student is never equal, and the power dynamics are always there.\nThe real challenge is whether the advisor is aware of these power dynamics and how they use them. When in disagreement, does the student have the real freedom to say no? Does the advisor sincerely feel comfortable to be challenged? Navigating these power dynamics is art for both students and advisors, but it’s on the advisors to practice and ensure students feel safe and respected."

    "text": "Editor note: This blog post is adapted from the InfluxData blog post series, make sure to also check out the original posts 1 2.\nNote: Thanks to InfluxData for sponsoring this work as a summer intern project\nThis blog describes our experience implementing StringView in the Rust implementation of Apache Arrow, and integrating it into Apache DataFusion, significantly accelerating string-intensive queries in the ClickBench benchmark by 20%- 200% (Figure 11).\nGetting significant end-to-end performance improvements was non-trivial. Implementing StringView itself was only a fraction of the effort required. Among other things, we had to optimize UTF-8 validation, implement unintuitive compiler optimizations, tune block sizes, and time GC to realize the FDAP ecosystem’s benefit. With other members of the open source community, we were able to overcome performance bottlenecks that could have killed the project. We would like to contribute by explaining the challenges and solutions in more detail so that more of the community can learn from our experience.\nStringView is based on a simple idea: avoid some string copies and accelerate comparisons with inlined prefixes. Like most great ideas, it is “obvious” only after someone describes it clearly. Although simple, straightforward implementation actually slows down performance for almost every query. We must, therefore, apply astute observations and diligent engineering to realize the actual benefits from StringView.\nAlthough this journey was successful, not all research ideas are as lucky. To accelerate the adoption of research into industry, it is valuable to integrate research prototypes with practical systems. Understanding the nuances of real-world systems makes it more likely that research designs will lead to practical system improvements.\nStringView support was released as part of arrow-rs v52.2.0 and DataFusion v41.0.0. You can try it by setting the schema_force_string_view DataFusion configuration option, and we are hard at work with the community to make it the default. We invite everyone to try it out, take advantage of the effort invested so far, and contribute to making it better."

    "text": "Section 1: What is StringView?\nThe concept of inlined strings with prefixes (called “German Strings” by Andy Pavlo, in homage to TUM, where the Umbra paper that describes them originated) has been used in many recent database systems (Velox, Polars, DuckDB, CedarDB, etc.) and was introduced to Arrow as a new StringViewArray2 type. Arrow’s original StringArray is very memory efficient but less effective for certain operations. StringViewArray accelerates string-intensive operations via prefix inlining and a more flexible and compact string representation.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Use StringArray and StringViewArray to represent the same string content.\n\n\nA StringViewArray consists of three components:\n\nThe view array\n\nThe buffers\n\nThe buffer pointers (IDs) that map buffer offsets to their physical locations\n\nEach view is 16 bytes long, and its contents differ based on the string’s length:\n\nstring length &lt; 12 bytes: the first four bytes store the string length, and the remaining 12 bytes store the inlined string.\n\nstring length &gt; 12 bytes: the string is stored in a separate buffer. The length is again stored in the first 4 bytes, followed by the buffer id (4 bytes), the buffer offset (4 bytes), and the prefix (first 4 bytes) of the string.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of the same logical content (left) using StringArray (middle) and StringViewArray (right):\n\nThe first string – “Apache DataFusion” – is 17 bytes long, and both StringArray and StringViewArray store the string’s bytes at the beginning of the buffer. The StringViewArray also inlines the first 4 bytes – “Apac” – in the view.\n\nThe second string, “InfluxDB” is only 8 bytes long, so StringViewArray completely inlines the string content in the view struct while StringArray stores the string in the buffer as well.\n\nThe third string “Arrow Rust Impl” is 15 bytes long and cannot be fully inlined. StringViewArray stores this in the same form as the first string.\n\nThe last string “Apache DataFusion” has the same content as the first string. It’s possible to use StringViewArray to avoid this duplication and reuse the bytes by pointing the view to the previous location.\n\nStringViewArray provides three opportunities for outperforming StringArray:\n\nLess copying via the offset + buffer format\n\nFaster comparisons using the inlined string prefix\n\nReusing repeated string values with the flexible view layout\n\nThe rest of this blog post discusses how to apply these opportunities in real query scenarios to improve performance, what challenges we encountered along the way, and how we solved them."

    "section": "Section 2: Faster Parquet Loading",
    "text": "Section 2: Faster Parquet Loading\nApache Parquet is the de facto format for storing large-scale analytical data commonly stored LakeHouse-style, such as Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Efficiently loading data from Parquet is thus critical to query performance in many important real-world workloads.\nParquet encodes strings (i.e., byte array) in a slightly different format than required for the original Arrow StringArray. The string length is encoded inline with the actual string data (as shown in Figure 4 left). As mentioned previously, StringArray requires the data buffer to be continuous and compact—the strings have to follow one after another. This requirement means that reading Parquet string data into an Arrow StringArray requires copying and consolidating the string bytes to a new buffer and tracking offsets in a separate array. Copying these strings is often wasteful. Typical queries filter out most data immediately after loading, so most of the copied data is quickly discarded.\nOn the other hand, reading Parquet data as a StringViewArray can re-use the same data buffer as storing the Parquet pages because StringViewArray does not require strings to be contiguous. For example, in Figure 4, the StringViewArray directly references the buffer with the decoded Parquet page. The string “Arrow Rust Impl” is represented by a view with offset 37 and length 15 into that buffer.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: StringViewArray avoids copying by reusing decoded Parquet pages.\n\n\nMini benchmark\nReusing Parquet buffers is great in theory, but how much does saving a copy actually matter? We can run the following benchmark in arrow-rs to find out:\ncargo bench --bench arrow_reader --features=\"arrow test_common experimental\" \"arrow_array_reader/Binary.*Array/plain encoded\"\nOur benchmarking machine shows that loading BinaryViewArray is almost 2x faster than loading BinaryArray (see next section about why this isn’t StringViewArray).\narrow_array_reader/BinaryArray/plain encoded                        time:   [315.86 µs 317.47 µs 319.00 µs]\n\narrow_array_reader/BinaryViewArray/plain encoded\ntime:   [162.08 µs 162.20 µs 162.32 µs]\nYou can read more on this arrow-rs issue: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5904\n\nSection 2.1: From Binary to Strings\nYou may wonder why we reported performance for BinaryViewArray when this post is about StringViewArray. Surprisingly, initially, our implementation to read StringViewArray from Parquet was much slower than StringArray. Why? TLDR: Although reading StringViewArray copied less data, the initial implementation also spent much more time validating UTF-8 (as shown in Figure 5).\nStrings are stored as byte sequences. When reading data from (potentially untrusted) Parquet files, a Parquet decoder must ensure those byte sequences are valid UTF-8 strings, and most programming languages, including Rust, include highly optimized routines for doing so.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Time to load strings from Parquet. The UTF-8 validation advantage initially eliminates the advantage of reduced copying for StringViewArray.\n\n\nA StringArray can be validated in a single call to the UTF-8 validation function as it has a continuous string buffer. As long as the underlying buffer is UTF-83, all strings in the array must be UTF-8. The Rust parquet reader makes a single function call to validate the entire buffer.\nHowever, validating an arbitrary StringViewArray requires validating each string with a separate call to the validation function, as the underlying buffer may also contain non-string data (for example, the lengths in Parquet pages).\nUTF-8 validation in Rust is highly optimized and favors longer strings (as shown in Figure 6), likely because it leverages SIMD instructions to perform parallel validation. The benefit of a single function call to validate UTF-8 over a function call for each string more than eliminates the advantage of avoiding the copy for StringViewArray.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: UTF-8 validation throughput vs string length—StringArray’s contiguous buffer can be validated much faster than StringViewArray’s buffer.\n\n\nDoes this mean we should only use StringArray? No! Thankfully, there’s a clever way out. The key observation is that in many real-world datasets, 99% of strings are shorter than 128 bytes, meaning the encoded length values are smaller than 128, in which case the length itself is also valid UTF-8 (in fact, it is ASCII).\nThis observation means we can optimize validating UTF-8 strings in Parquet pages by treating the length bytes as part of a single large string as long as the length value is less than 128. Put another way, prior to this optimization, the length bytes act as string boundaries, which require a UTF-8 validation on each string. After this optimization, only those strings with lengths larger than 128 bytes (less than 1% of the strings in the ClickBench dataset) are string boundaries, significantly increasing the UTF-8 validation chunk size and thus improving performance.\nThe actual implementation is only nine lines of Rust (with 30 lines of comments). You can find more details in the related arrow-rs issue: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5995. As expected, with this optimization, loading StringViewArray is almost 2x faster than loading StringArray.\n\n\nSection 2.2: Be Careful About Implicit Copies\nAfter all the work to avoid copying strings when loading from Parquet, performance was still not as good as expected. We tracked the problem to a few implicit data copies that we weren’t aware of, as described in this issue.\nThe copies we eventually identified come from the following innocent-looking line of Rust code, where self.buf is a reference counted pointer that should transform without copying into a buffer for use in StringViewArray.\nlet block_id = output.append_block(self.buf.clone().into());\nHowever, Rust-type coercion rules favored a blanket implementation that did copy data. This implementation is shown in the following code block where the impl&lt;T: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;&gt; will accept any type that implements AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt; and copies the data to create a new buffer. To avoid copying, users need to explicitly call from_vec, which consumes the Vec and transforms it into a buffer.\nimpl&lt;T: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;&gt; From&lt;T&gt; for Buffer {\n    fn from(p: T) -&gt; Self {\n        // copies data here\n     ...\n    }\n}\nimpl Buffer { \n  pub fn from_vec&lt;T&gt;(data: Vec&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Self {\n// zero-copy transformation\n...\n  }\n}\nDiagnosing this implicit copy was time-consuming as it relied on subtle Rust language semantics. We needed to track every step of the data flow to ensure every copy was necessary. To help other users and prevent future mistakes, we also removed the implicit API from arrow-rs in favor of an explicit API. Using this approach, we found and fixed several other unintentional copies in the code base—hopefully, the change will help other downstream users avoid unnecessary copies.\n\n\nSection 2.3: Help the Compiler by Giving it More Information\nThe Rust compiler’s automatic optimizations mostly work very well for a wide variety of use cases, but sometimes, it needs additional hints to generate the most efficient code. When profiling the performance of view construction, we found, counterintuitively, that constructing long strings was 10x faster than constructing short strings, which made short strings slower on StringViewArray than on StringArray!\nAs described in Section 1, StringViewArray treats long and short strings differently. Short strings (&lt;12 bytes) directly inline to the view struct, while long strings only inline the first 4 bytes. The code to construct a view looks something like this:\nif len &lt;= 12 {\n   // Construct 16 byte view for short string\n   let mut view_buffer = [0; 16];\n   view_buffer[0..4].copy_from_slice(&len.to_le_bytes());\n   view_buffer[4..4 + data.len()].copy_from_slice(data);\n   ...\n} else {      \n   // Construct 16 byte view for long string\n   ByteView {\n       length: len,\n       prefix: u32::from_le_bytes(data[0..4].try_into().unwrap()),\n       buffer_index: block_id,\n       offset,\n   }\n}\nIt appears that both branches of the code should be fast: they both involve copying at most 16 bytes of data and some memory shift/store operations. How could the branch for short strings be 10x slower?\nLooking at the assembly code using godbolt, we (with help from Ao Li) found the compiler used CPU load instructions to copy the fixed-sized 4 bytes to the view for long strings, but it calls a function, ptr::copy_non_overlapping, to copy the inlined bytes to the view for short strings. The difference is that long strings have a prefix size (4 bytes) known at compile time, so the compiler directly uses efficient CPU instructions. But, since the size of the short string is unknown to the compiler, it has to call the general-purpose function ptr::copy_non_coverlapping. Making a function call is significant unnecessary overhead compared to a CPU copy instruction.\nHowever, we know something the compiler doesn’t know: the short string size is not arbitrary—it must be between 0 and 12 bytes, and we can leverage this information to avoid the function call. Our solution generates 13 copies of the function using generics, one for each of the possible prefix lengths. The code looks as follows, and checking the assembly code, we confirmed there are no calls to ptr::copy_non_overlapping, and only native CPU instructions are used. For more details, see the ticket.\nfn make_inlined_view&lt;const LEN: usize&gt;(data: &[u8]) -&gt; u128 {\n     let mut view_buffer = [0; 16];\n     view_buffer[0..4].copy_from_slice(&(LEN as u32).to_le_bytes());\n     view_buffer[4..4 + LEN].copy_from_slice(&data[..LEN]);\n     u128::from_le_bytes(view_buffer)\n}\npub fn make_view(data: &[u8], block_id: u32, offset: u32) -&gt; u128 {\n     let len = data.len();\n     // generate special code for each of the 13 possible lengths\n     match len {\n         0 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;0&gt;(data),\n         1 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;1&gt;(data),\n         2 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;2&gt;(data),\n         3 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;3&gt;(data),\n         4 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;4&gt;(data),\n         5 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;5&gt;(data),\n         6 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;6&gt;(data),\n         7 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;7&gt;(data),\n         8 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;8&gt;(data),\n         9 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;9&gt;(data),\n         10 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;10&gt;(data),\n         11 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;11&gt;(data),\n         12 =&gt; make_inlined_view::&lt;12&gt;(data),\n         _ =&gt; {\n           // handle long string\n}}}\n\n\nSection 2.4: End-to-End Query Performance\nIn the previous sections, we went out of our way to make sure loading StringViewArray is faster than StringArray. Before going further, we wanted to verify if obsessing about reducing copies and function calls has actually improved end-to-end performance in real-life queries. To do this, we evaluated a ClickBench query (Q20) in DataFusion that counts how many URLs contain the word \"google\":\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM hits WHERE \"URL\" LIKE '%google%';\nThis is a relatively simple query; most of the time is spent on loading the “URL” column to find matching rows. The query plan looks like this:\nProjection: COUNT(*) [COUNT(*):Int64;N]\n  Aggregate: groupBy=[[]], aggr=[[COUNT(*)]] [COUNT(*):Int64;N]\n    Filter: hits.URL LIKE Utf8(\"%google%\")\n      TableScan: hits \nWe ran the benchmark in the DataFusion repo like this:\ncargo run --profile release-nonlto --bin dfbench -- clickbench --queries-path benchmarks/queries/clickbench/queries.sql --iterations 3 --query 20 --path benchmarks/data/hits.parquet --string-view\nWith StringViewArray we saw a 24% end-to-end performance improvement, as shown in Figure 7. With the --string-view argument, the end-to-end query time is 944.3 ms, 869.6 ms, 861.9 ms (three iterations). Without --string-view, the end-to-end query time is 1186.1 ms, 1126.1 ms, 1138.3 ms.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: StringView reduces end-to-end query time by 24% on ClickBench Q20.\n\n\nWe also double-checked with detailed profiling and verified that the time reduction is indeed due to faster Parquet loading."

    "section": "Section 3: Faster String Operations",
    "text": "Section 3: Faster String Operations\nWe have discussed the nuances required to accelerate Parquet loading using StringViewArray by reusing buffers and reducing copies. In this second part of the post, we describe the rest of the journey: implementing additional efficient operations for real query processing.\n\nSection 3.1: Faster comparison\nString comparison is ubiquitous; it is the core of cmp, min/max, and like/ilike kernels. StringViewArray is designed to accelerate such comparisons using the inlined prefix—the key observation is that, in many cases, only the first few bytes of the string determine the string comparison results.\nFor example, to compare the strings InfluxDB with Apache DataFusion, we only need to look at the first byte to determine the string ordering or equality. In this case, since A is earlier in the alphabet than I, Apache DataFusion sorts first, and we know the strings are not equal. Despite only needing the first byte, comparing these strings when stored as a StringArray requires two memory accesses: 1) load the string offset and 2) use the offset to locate the string bytes. For low-level operations such as cmp that are invoked millions of times in the very hot paths of queries, avoiding this extra memory access can make a measurable difference in query performance.\nFor StringViewArray, typically, only one memory access is needed to load the view struct. Only if the result can not be determined from the prefix is the second memory access required. For the example above, there is no need for the second access. This technique is very effective in practice: the second access is never necessary for the more than 60% of real-world strings which are shorter than 12 bytes, as they are stored completely in the prefix.\nHowever, functions that operate on strings must be specialized to take advantage of the inlined prefix. In addition to low-level comparison kernels, we implemented a wide range of other StringViewArray operations that cover the functions and operations seen in ClickBench queries. Supporting StringViewArray in all string operations takes quite a bit of effort, and thankfully the Arrow and DataFusion communities are already hard at work doing so (see https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/11752 if you want to help out).\n\n\nSection 3.2: Faster take and filter\nAfter a filter operation such as WHERE url &lt;&gt; ‘’ to avoid processing empty urls, DataFusion will often coalesce results to form a new array with only the passing elements. This coalescing ensures the batches are sufficiently sized to benefit from vectorized processing in subsequent steps.\nThe coalescing operation is implemented using the take and filter kernels in arrow-rs. For StringArray, these kernels require copying the string contents to a new buffer without “holes” in between. This copy can be expensive especially when the new array is large.\nHowever, take and filter for StringViewArray can avoid the copy by reusing buffers from the old array. The kernels only need to create a new list of views that point at the same strings within the old buffers. Figure 8 illustrates the difference between the output of both string representations. StringArray creates two new strings at offsets 0-17 and 17-32, while StringViewArray simply points to the original buffer at offsets 0 and 25.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Zero-copy take/filter for StringViewArray\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.3: When to GC?\nZero-copy take/filter is great for generating large arrays quickly, but it is suboptimal for highly selective filters, where most of the strings are filtered out. When the cardinality drops, StringViewArray buffers become sparse—only a small subset of the bytes in the buffer’s memory are referred to by any view. This leads to excessive memory usage, especially in a filter-then-coalesce scenario. For example, a StringViewArray with 10M strings may only refer to 1M strings after some filter operations; however, due to zero-copy take/filter, the (reused) 10M buffers can not be released/reused.\nTo release unused memory, we implemented a garbage collection (GC) routine to consolidate the data into a new buffer to release the old sparse buffer(s). As the GC operation copies strings, similarly to StringArray, we must be careful about when to call it. If we call GC too early, we cause unnecessary copying, losing much of the benefit of StringViewArray. If we call GC too late, we hold large buffers for too long, increasing memory use and decreasing cache efficiency. The Polars blog on StringView also refers to the challenge presented by garbage collection timing.\narrow-rs implements the GC process, but it is up to users to decide when to call it. We leverage the semantics of the query engine and observed that the CoalseceBatchesExec operator, which merge smaller batches to a larger batch, is often used after the record cardinality is expected to shrink, which aligns perfectly with the scenario of GC in StringViewArray. We, therefore, implemented the GC procedure inside CoalseceBatchesExec[^5],with a heuristic that estimates when the buffers are too sparse.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.4: The art of function inlining: not too much, not too little\nLike string inlining, function inlining is the process of embedding a short function into the caller to avoid the overhead of function calls (caller/callee save). Usually, the Rust compiler does a good job of deciding when to inline. However, it is possible to override its default using the #[inline(always)] directive. In performance-critical code, inlined code allows us to organize large functions into smaller ones without paying the runtime cost of function invocation.\nHowever, function inlining is not always better, as it leads to larger function bodies that are harder for LLVM to optimize (for example, suboptimal register spilling) and risk overflowing the CPU’s instruction cache. We observed several performance regressions where function inlining caused slower performance when implementing the StringViewArray comparison kernels. Careful inspection and tuning of the code was required to aid the compiler in generating efficient code. More details can be found in this PR: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/5900.\n\n\nSection 3.5: Buffer size tuning\nStringViewArray permits multiple buffers, which enables a flexible buffer layout and potentially reduces the need to copy data. However, a large number of buffers slows down the performance of other operations. For example, get_array_memory_size() needs to sum the memory size of each buffer, which takes a long time with thousands of small buffers. In certain cases, we found that multiple calls to concat_batches lead to arrays with millions of buffers, which was prohibitively expensive.\nFor example, consider a StringViewArray with the previous default buffer size of 8 KB. With this configuration, holding 4GB of string data requires almost half a million buffers! Larger buffer sizes are needed for larger arrays, but we cannot arbitrarily increase the default buffer size, as small arrays would consume too much memory (most arrays require at least one buffer). Buffer sizing is especially problematic in query processing, as we often need to construct small batches of string arrays, and the sizes are unknown at planning time.\nTo balance the buffer size trade-off, we again leverage the query processing (DataFusion) semantics to decide when to use larger buffers. While coalescing batches, we combine multiple small string arrays and set a smaller buffer size to keep the total memory consumption low. In string aggregation, we aggregate over an entire Datafusion partition, which can generate a large number of strings, so we set a larger buffer size (2MB).\nTo assist situations where the semantics are unknown, we also implemented a classic dynamic exponential buffer size growth strategy, which starts with a small buffer size (8KB) and doubles the size of each new buffer up to 2MB. We implemented this strategy in arrow-rs and enabled it by default so that other users of StringViewArray can also benefit from this optimization. See this issue for more details: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6094.\n\n\nSection 3.6: End-to-end query performance\nWe have made significant progress in optimizing StringViewArray filtering operations. Now, let’s test it in the real world to see how it works!\nLet’s consider ClickBench query 22, which selects multiple string fields (URL, Title, and SearchPhase) and applies several filters.\nSELECT \n  \"SearchPhrase\", \n  MIN(\"URL\"), MIN(\"Title\"), COUNT(*) AS c, COUNT(DISTINCT \"UserID\") \nFROM hits \nWHERE \n  \"Title\" LIKE '%Google%' AND \n  \"URL\" NOT LIKE '%.google.%' AND \n  \"SearchPhrase\" &lt;&gt; '' \nGROUP BY \"SearchPhrase\" \nORDER BY c DESC \nLIMIT 10;\nWe ran the benchmark using the following command in the DataFusion repo. Again, the --string-view option means we use StringViewArray instead of StringArray.\ncargo run --profile release-nonlto --bin dfbench -- clickbench --queries-path benchmarks/queries/clickbench/queries.sql --iterations 3 --query 22 --path benchmarks/data/hits.parquet --string-view\nTo eliminate the impact of the faster Parquet reading using StringViewArray (see the first part of this blog), Figure 9 plots only the time spent in FilterExec. Without StringViewArray, the filter takes 7.17s; with StringViewArray, the filter only takes 4.86s, a 32% reduction in time. Moreover, we see a 17% improvement in end-to-end query performance.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: StringViewArray reduces the filter time by 32% on ClickBench query 22."

    "text": "Section 4: Faster String Aggregation\nSo far, we have discussed how to exploit two StringViewArray features: reduced copy and faster filtering. This section focuses on reusing string bytes to repeat string values.\nAs described in part one of this blog, if two strings have identical values, StringViewArray can use two different views pointing at the same buffer range, thus avoiding repeating the string bytes in the buffer. This makes StringViewArray similar to an Arrow DictionaryArray that stores Strings—both array types work well for strings with only a few distinct values.\nDeduplicating string values can significantly reduce memory consumption in StringViewArray. However, this process is expensive and involves hashing every string and maintaining a hash table, and so it cannot be done by default when creating a StringViewArray. We introduced an opt-in string deduplication mode in arrow-rs for advanced users who know their data has a small number of distinct values, and where the benefits of reduced memory consumption outweigh the additional overhead of array construction.\nOnce again, we leverage DataFusion query semantics to identify StringViewArray with duplicate values, such as aggregation queries with multiple group keys. For example, some ClickBench queries group by two columns:\n\nUserID (an integer with close to 1 M distinct values)\n\nMobilePhoneModel (a string with less than a hundred distinct values)\n\nIn this case, the output row count is count(distinct UserID) * count(distinct MobilePhoneModel), which is 100M. Each string value of MobilePhoneModel is repeated 1M times. With StringViewArray, we can save space by pointing the repeating values to the same underlying buffer.\nFaster string aggregation with StringView is part of a larger project to improve DataFusion aggregation performance. We have a proof of concept implementation with StringView that can improve the multi-column string aggregation by 20%. We would love your help to get it production ready!"

    "text": "Section 5: StringView Pitfalls\nMost existing blog posts (including this one) focus on the benefits of using StringViewArray over other string representations such as StringArray. As we have discussed, even though it requires a significant engineering investment to realize, StringViewArray is a major improvement over StringArray in many cases.\nHowever, there are several cases where StringViewArray is slower than StringArray. For completeness, we have listed those instances here:\n\nTiny strings (when strings are shorter than 8 bytes): every element of the StringViewArray consumes at least 16 bytes of memory—the size of the view struct. For an array of tiny strings, StringViewArray consumes more memory than StringArray and thus can cause slower performance due to additional memory pressure on the CPU cache.\n\nMany repeated short strings: Similar to the first point, StringViewArray can be slower and require more memory than a DictionaryArray because 1) it can only reuse the bytes in the buffer when the strings are longer than 12 bytes and 2) 32-bit offsets are always used, even when a smaller size (8 bit or 16 bit) could represent all the distinct values.\n\nFiltering: As we mentioned above, StringViewArrays often consume more memory than the corresponding StringArray, and memory bloat quickly dominates the performance without GC. However, invoking GC also reduces the benefits of less copying so must be carefully tuned."

Our evaluations on ClickBench queries show that StringView can improve the performance of string-intensive workloads by up to 2x.\nGiven that DataFusion already performs very well on ClickBench, the level of end-to-end performance improvement using StringViewArray shows the power of this technique and, of course, is a win for DataFusion and the systems that build upon it.\nStringView is a big project that has received tremendous community support.

However, applying this (great) idea in practice requires a significant investment in careful software engineering. Again, we encourage the research community to continue to help apply research ideas to industrial systems, such as DataFusion, as doing so provides valuable perspectives when evaluating future research questions for the greatest potential impact."

    "section": "",
    "text": "North star\n\nResearch should connect to real people.\n\n\nImpact definition\nResearch impact is defined by the number of connections between the paper and the users.\nNote that the research paper itself does not produce an impact, as nobody’s life is changed because of reading a paper—we are not philosophers. This means that the research impact is always indirect; we have to apply the research to a system with real users.\nDue to the indirect nature of the research’s impact, some effort must be made to connect the research to users.\nMy take: Researchers should take a holistic approach, seamlessly threading their work from the research paper to individual users.\n\n\nNo-goals\nNo goals help define goals. I’ve made all three types of mistakes, and this is my self-reflection to avoid repeating them.\n We are tempted to work on projects proven to be publishable, e.g., improving an existing published method. However, it is not uncommon to see chains of research papers working on a topic irrelevant to the rest of the world. In other words, the impact of a research paper is not defined by how many papers cite it.\n Researchers have the privilege to go wild and think big. But this privilege can be misused. Often, it is used to fool ourselves. Some research (e.g., physics and math) are/can be far from users, but not computer science – one of applied science. As applied scientists, we must ensure our “science” applies to the real world instead of just intellectual exercise.\nSome research (e.g., theory) in applied science still enjoys greater freedom than others. However, my research topics are outside them.\n This is the most common research mistake. We often believe that researchers should focus on making good ideas, and someone else will go off to make it happen. This is not true. There are way too many good ideas, yet few are impactful.\nMost ideas are just combinations of existing techniques, and it is hard to believe anything fundamental will be discovered in system research.\nMost importantly, a good idea evolves with the system it builds upon. It is a feedback loop that tries, fails, and repeats. And the great idea that comes out of the system always differs from its initial version. It is never the case that the research flow is a single-directional graph with no feedback from downstream users.\n\n\nToday’s problem vs tomorrow’s problem\nBoth types of problems are important and meaningful. I don’t work on tomorrow’s problems (but I agree that someone must work on future problems).\nWhy not work on future problems:\n\nWe have enough of today’s problems to work on.\nIt’s easier to fool ourselves while working on future problems.\n\nDon’t fool ourselves:\n\nWe like tomorrow’s problem because it’s easier to claim novelty – future problems naturally come with novelty.\nWe like tomorrow’s problem because we don’t have to establish user connections. Instead, we use it as an excuse to avoid working on the most important and challenging parts. We are free to propose anything we want, work around any challenges, and eventually disconnect from the rest of the world.\nHow do we avoid imaginary research? How can we ensure today’s solution is not funny when tomorrow’s problem arrives? Why work on it when future researchers will beat today’s solution with much more practical considerations?\n\n\n\nEngineering problem vs research problem\n My take on research vs engineering problems:\n\nAll engineering problems are meaningful as they come from users and practitioners—no one invented them out of thin air.\nAll research problems are publishable by definition.\nMost engineering problems are also research problems, evidenced by the fact that they haven’t been solved — meaning they are challenging, resource-consuming, or require a deep understanding of practical nuances, which are the definitions of research problems.\nResearch problems, without being grounded by engineering problems, are unlikely to be meaningful.\n\n\n\nWhy this statement?\nI probably only need to publish one more paper to graduate, as I have already published two papers in VLDB/SIGMOD. Moreover, my chance to stay in academia is quite low, meaning that this one-more-paper is likely the last paper I drive to publish in my career.\nI have lots of cool ideas, but I have to choose only one. This statement helps me to crystalize my thoughts when deciding what to work on. It would be great if I knew all of these early in my Ph.D., but it is still not too late to write them down.\nI can get lost when struggling to publish a paper or being determined to secure a faculty job. Everyone starts with the intention of doing meaningful research, but practical considerations forced them to do otherwise. If I encounter those situations (again), this statement would remind me of my north star."

For a tree (like blow), we get a traversal order of D -&gt; E -&gt; B -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; C -&gt; A: \nApplying our physical graph above, we get an execution order of:\n\nCsvExec (orders.csv)\nRepartitionExec\nFilterExec\nCoalesceBatchesExec\nRepartitionExec\nCoalesceBatchesExec\nCsvExec (lineitem.csv)\nRepartitionExec\nRepartitionExec\nCoalesceBatchesExec\nHashJoinExec\nCoalesceBatchesExec\nProjectionExec\n\nThe RepartitionExec and CoalesceBatchesExec are executors that partition the data for multi-thread processing (based on the Volcano execution style).\nA simplified, single-threaded, no-partitioned execution order would be:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    e1[\"CsvExec (orders.csv)\"] --&gt; FilterExec\n    FilterExec --&gt; e2 \n    e2[\"CsvExec (lineitem.csv)\"] --&gt; HashJoinExec\n    HashJoinExec --&gt; ProjectionExec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading from disk\nCSV files are row-based, and we read them row by row, it is efficient when we frequently need to read the whole row. However, modern data analytic workloads do not always need to read the whole row; they often only need to read a subset of columns. In our example above, we only need to read l_orderkey, l_shipdate, o_orderdate, o_orderkey from the tables. If using a row-based file format (like CSV), we need to load all columns into memory, which is inefficient. Column-based file formats (like Apache Parquet) can be more efficient in this case.\nTODO: draw a figure about columnar and row storage format."
